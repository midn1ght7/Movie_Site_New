# Movie_Site_New

A Django-based movie recommendation system that includes 4 types of recommender systems. 2 types of content-based, and 2 types of collaborative. Recommender systems are based on k-nearest neighbors algorithms using cosine and euclidean distances. The database was filled using TMDB API (movies) and MovieLens dataset (ratings).
Movie Recommendation App is my Engineer's Thesis project.
